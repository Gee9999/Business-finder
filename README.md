# Business Finder â€“ School Wide Filter Edition

Filters logic:  
1. Negative keywords: directory, listing, yellowpages removed.  
2. Keeps if domain ends with ALLOWED_SUFFIXES **or** (if strict unchecked) domain contains 'school'.

Edit `ALLOWED_SUFFIXES` or toggle the strict checkbox for flexibility.
