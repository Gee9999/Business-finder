# Business Finder – School‑Focused Edition

* Filters DuckDuckGo results to reduce directories:  
  - Adds negative keywords (`-directory -listing -yellowpages`).  
  - Keeps only domains ending with `.edu.za` or `.school.za`.  
* Async scraping for speed.  
* Optional Hunter.io enrichment.

## Adjust filters
* Edit `NEGATIVE_TERMS` or `SCHOOL_SUFFIXES` in `scraper.py` to suit other institution types or countries.
